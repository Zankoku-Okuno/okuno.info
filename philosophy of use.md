 * Write everything down.

   Don't worry about judging the idea yet.
   You'll know later if it's too stupid, and then you can delete it.
   Keeping tasks in your head leads to feeling more overwhelmed than you actually are.

 * Anything that takes less than two minutes, do immediately.

 * Order-one accessibility.

   You should not need to move anything out of the way to access the thing you need now.
   Bonus points for being able to access it one-handed.

 * There are only finite days before death.

 * Have variance in your schedule.

   Take a day off in the week, take time off during the year.
   Taking time off means you leave the work entirely behind.

 * Review cycles.

   If you don't review how things have been going, you cannot adjust yourself to be more effective.
   Have multiple levels of review cycles, and write the results down for referecne on the next review(s).

 * Use external brains for one-off memories.

   If a memory isn't going to be relevant more than once, do not waste your time memorizing the information.
   Even if you do, your memory is much more fallible than digital memory.

 * Determine when you are more/less productive, and modulate actions accordingly.

 * Never leave a room without something in your hand.

   It's a bit hyperbolic, but if you aim for that, you'll find things get organized while you weren't paying attention.
   Really, this is a special case of "Anything that takes less than 2 minutes".

 * The product of a human life is to design a life that it wants to live.

 * Calm people live, panicked people die.

 * Avoid false efficiency.

   Checking items off the todo list is not the end goal.
   It may be a good indicator most of the time, but no metric encapsulates success or fulfilment.
   Therefore, don't get attached to the metric.

 * Multiplicative vs. Additive Value

   The prototypical additive value is creating a product which creates value, but on which nothing else builds.
   The prototypical multiplicative value is creating a product from which every other activity derives value.

 * Watch out for brain noise.

   If you're still finding yourself thinking about what to do next (i.e. during a commute), then
   make sure you have the app on you, and if you can't do anything, have a light but captivating game available.

 * Mainenance doesn't happen until de-clutter is done.
